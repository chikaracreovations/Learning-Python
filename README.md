# Learning Python 🐍

Welcome! This repository contains Python programs and practice exercises I'm writing as I learn the language.

## 📚 Purpose

I'm using this repo to:

- Practice Python basics and beyond
- Keep track of my learning progress
- Organize my code and experiments
- Share my journey with others

## 🧠 Topics I’ll Cover

Some of the areas I plan to explore:

- Variables and Data Types
- Control Flow (if, loops)
- Functions
- Modules and Packages
- File Handling
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Error Handling
- Data Structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, etc.)
- Basic Algorithms
- External Libraries

## 🛠 How It's Organized

Each folder or file will typically represent a concept or small project. File names and comments will be clear to show what I'm working on.

## 🚀 Getting Started
